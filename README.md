### Agent Architecture

![Customer Service Agent Workflow](customer_service_workflow.png)

The agent is built using a multi-modal architecture, combining text and video inputs to provide a rich and interactive experience. It mocks interactions with various tools and services, including a product catalog, inventory management, order processing, and appointment scheduling systems. The agent also utilizes a session management system to maintain context across interactions and personalize the customer experience.

It is important to notice that this agent is not integrated to an actual backend and the behaviour is based on mocked tools. If you would like to implement this agent with actual backend integration you will need to edit [customer_service/tools.py](./customer_service/tools/tools.py)

Because the tools are mocked you might notice that some requested changes will not be applied. For instance newly added item to cart will not show if later a user asks the agent to list all items.

#### Agent State - Default customer information

The agent's session state is preloaded with sample customer data, simulating a real conversation. Ideally, this state should be loaded from a CRM system at the start of the conversation, using the user's information. This assumes that either the agent authenticates the user or the user is already logged in. If this behavior is expected to be modified edit the [get_customer(current_customer_id: str) in customer.py](./customer_service/entities/customer.py)

#### Tools

The agent has access to the following tools:

- `send_call_companion_link(phone_number: str) -> str`: Sends a link for video connection.
- `approve_discount(type: str, value: float, reason: str) -> str`: Approves a discount (within pre-defined limits).

- `get_book_recommendations(book_genre: str, customer_id: str) -> dict`: Suggests suitable books for a given genre.
- `check_product_availability(product_id: str, store_id: str) -> dict`: Checks book stock.

## Setup and Installations

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Google ADK SDK (installed via Poetry)
- Google Cloud Project (for Vertex AI Gemini integration)

### Installation
1.  **Prerequisites:**

    For the Agent Engine deployment steps, you will need
    a Google Cloud Project. Once you have created your project,
    [install the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
    Then run the following command to authenticate with your project:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    ```
    You also need to enable certain APIs. Run the following command to enable
    the required APIs:
    ```bash
    gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
    ```

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
    cd adk-samples/python/agents/customer-service
    ```

    For the rest of this tutorial **ensure you remain in the `agents/customer-service` directory**.

2.  Install dependencies using Poetry:

- if you have not installed poetry before then run `pip install poetry` first. then you can create your virtual environment and install all dependencies using:

  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```

  To activate the virtual environment run:

  ```bash
  poetry env activate
  ```

3.  Set up Google Cloud credentials:

    - Ensure you have a Google Cloud project.
    - Make sure you have the Vertex AI API enabled in your project.
    - Set the `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` environment variables. You can set them in your `.env` file (modify and rename .env_sample file to .env) or directly in your shell. Alternatively you can edit [customer_service/config.py](./customer_service/config.py)

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_HERE
    export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=0
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
    ```

## Running the Agent

You can run the agent using the ADK commant in your terminal.
from the root project directory:

1.  Run agent in CLI:

    ```bash
    adk run customer_service
    ```

2.  Run agent with ADK Web UI:
    ```bash
    adk web
    ```
    Select the customer_service from the dropdown

### Example Interaction

Here's a quick example of how a user might interact with the agent:

**User:**:
hi there

**Agent**:
Hey Alex, I see you've been a Literati Library & Bookstore customer for a couple of years now - we appreciate your business! I also see you have a few things in your cart already. How can I help you find your next great read today?

**User**:
Yeah, so I'm a bit confused. I just finished reading some mystery novels and I loved them. I'm looking for something similar but maybe with a different twist. I have a couple of books in my cart but I'm not sure if they're the right ones for me.

**Agent**:
I understand â€“ finding the perfect next book can be exciting but also overwhelming! Let's figure this out together. I'd love to help you discover some great mystery novels with unique twists. To best help you, would you be willing to share a quick video call so we can discuss your reading preferences in more detail?

**User**:
Sure, how do I do that?

**Agent**:
I just texted you a link to the number in your profile. Just click on that, and it'll open a secure video connection.

```tool_code
print(send_call_companion_link(phone_number='+12065550123'))
```

```tool_outputs
{'status': 'success', 'message': 'Link sent to +12065550123'}
```

**User**:
Okay, I clicked the link...can you see this?

**Agent**:
Yes I can see you Alex! I'd love to hear more about the mystery novels you've enjoyed recently. Can you tell me about some of your favorites and what specifically you liked about them?

**User**:
Yes of course!
